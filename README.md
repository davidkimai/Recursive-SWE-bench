# Recursive-SWE-bench
Recursive-SWE-bench extends the established SWE-bench framework to measure adaptive intelligence in software engineering tasks through recursive evaluation paradigms. While traditional benchmarks measure static, single-pass performance, Recursive-SWE-bench evaluates dynamic problem-solving capabilities across iterative refinement cycles.
